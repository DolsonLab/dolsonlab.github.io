# Agenda

1. Context
2. Open science workflows
3. Tools for open science

I almost listed this as a sandbox - please chime in with your own thoughts!

# What is open science?

---
class: center, middle

# Open science is [not one thing](https://smallpondscience.com/2016/03/14/open-science-is-not-one-thing/)

Maybe it's [not even a useful umbrella term](http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2019/07/13/i-hate-open-science/)

---
# The open science umbrella

- Free sharing of 
  - data
  - code
  - ideas
  - papers

- Transparency in how science is carried out

- Reproducibility

- Diversity, equity, and inclusion

Discussion: Anything I'm missing?

---

For the purposes of this tutorial open science is 

# A shared ideal to strive for
(all we can do is make incremental progress)


---
class: center, middle

# I'm not going to talk about policies

---
# Considerations

- Not all or nothing 

--

- [Need to think about social implications](https://medium.com/@denalbz/reimagining-open-science-through-a-feminist-lens-546f3d10fa65)

--

- Obstacles to open science aren't evenly distributed

--

- History of bad behavior in many "open" communities

--

- [Freedom vs. justice](https://medium.com/@beewithablog/open-is-cancelled-da7dd6f2aaaf)


---

# So why bother?

- ["Danger of being ignored > danger of being scooped"](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2014-open-and-tenured.html)

- Gain collaborators

- Refine your ideas

- Improve the efficacy of science

# My workflow

Unatainable ideal: a paper that could be reproduced with a button click

- Each paper gets a repo on [github](https://github.com)

--

- Write experimental code in C++

--

- Write web GUI, host on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)

--

- Run experiments on computing cluster; store queue submission scripts in repo

--

- Wrangle data in Python, analyze in R, store it all in an [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) file using [Reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/)

--

- Store data somewhere

--

- Write paper on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), syncing to github

--

- Get repo a DOI with [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)

--
  - Releases for preprint, submission, revision

---

class: center, middle
# Discussion: what is your workflow like?

---

# Aspirational workflow goals

- Automated testing via Travis CI

--

- Tutorials for all code

--

- Release R or Python packages when appropriate

--

- Detailed README explaining the contents of the repo

---

class: center, middle
# Discussion: what is a next step you could take to improve your workflow?

---

# Designing a workflow

- Make the behavior you want easy

--

- Use tools that reinforce each other

--

- My (untested) plan:

--

  - Every paper has its own repo

--

  - Make heavy used of the slack/github integration
  
--

  - Keep track of todo list as github issues

--

  - Github as default location for sharing updates

# Nuts and bolts

---

# ALL CAPS files

- LICENSE

- CITATION

- README.md

- CONTRIBUTING

- CODE_OF_CONDUCT
---



# Licenses

- You should have one

--

- Considerations:
  - Can other people use your stuff?
    - Do you care what license **they** use?
  - Can other people build on your stuff?
  - Do you want attribution?
  - Are you okay with commerical re-use?

--

- [Guide to choosing a license](https://choosealicense.com/)

--

- Discussion: Do you have a preferred license?

---


# Citation

- Can be a citation for a paper describing your code

- Get your repo a DOI with [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)

- Any other options people like?

---

# README

- Explain what's in the repo and how to use it

- Pointers to other resources

- Badges

- Can be pretty

---

# Contributing guidelines

If you want people to contribute, tell them how!

[Example](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/blob/infrastructure/CONTRIBUTING.md)

---

# Code of conduct

- Encourage diverse participants

- Normalize talking about stuff before it becomes a problem

- Examples:

  - [BEACON Congress](https://sites.google.com/view/beacon-congress-2020/code-of-conduct?authuser=0)
  - [Contributor covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)
  - [Carpentries code of conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html)
