   bio       : Sydney is a dual PhD student in Computer Science & Engineering and Evolution, Ecology, and Behavior. Broadly, her research explores how ecological interactions shape the course of evolution. Specifically, one branch of her work models how interactions between autocatalytic cycles could have contributed to abiogenesis. Another branch of her work models how game theortic interactions between cancer cells change drug response in different spatial environments.
